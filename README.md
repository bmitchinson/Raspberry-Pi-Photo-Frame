Created as a mother's day gift, this script enables a Raspberry Pi to download all images in a specific folder of a Gmail account. My family uses it to all email photos from our phones to a dedicated account, and the script refreshes it's local cache of all of them, then uses OSMC to display them all as a wallpaper.

Detailed in the blog post linked above, but this script isn't the best. One of my first projects.
