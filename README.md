# Raspberry-Pi-Photo-Frame
A series of background scripts for enabling a raspberry pi to download photos from a gmail account. Completed in May 2017 for mothers day. Looking back I would have done things a lot differently, but having only taken one CS course at the time, was proud of the result. Still in use today at home.
